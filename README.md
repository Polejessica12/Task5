# Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics

## Objective
To train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance using standard evaluation metrics.

## Dataset
Heart Disease Dataset  
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
- Loaded the dataset
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Predicted outcomes on test data
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Model Used
Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

## Evaluation Report
The Logistic Regression model was evaluated using standard performance metrics.
The accuracy score indicates that the model provides reliable predictions.

Precision shows that most of the predicted heart disease cases were correct,
while recall confirms that the model successfully identified the majority of actual cases.

The confusion matrix helped in analyzing correct and incorrect predictions in detail.

## Conclusion
The trained model performs well on test data and demonstrates good generalization ability.
This task improved understanding of model evaluation techniques in machine learning.
